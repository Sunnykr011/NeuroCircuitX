Focused on understanding Kirchhoffâ€™s Voltage Law (KVL).

Simulated closed-loop circuits and verified that all voltage drops add up to supply.

Explored where and why voltage drops occur in each part of the loop.

Mentally traced power flow in series connections to reinforce logic.

Started seeing the link between schematic structure and voltage behavior.
