Learned behavior of series vs parallel resistor arrangements.

Observed that in series: current stays same, voltage splits.

In parallel: voltage remains same, current divides among branches.

Used circuit trainers and quizzes online to reinforce the difference.

Created and reviewed my own example circuits to lock in the concept.
