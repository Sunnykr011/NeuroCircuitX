Got introduced to basic electrical quantities like voltage, current, resistance.

Used online circuit simulators to visualize current flow and voltage behavior.

Observed how power is distributed across elements using animated demos.

Took handwritten notes and started relating theory with practical logic.

Understood that energy used by a component appears as voltage drop.
