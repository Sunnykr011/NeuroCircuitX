Practiced Ohmâ€™s Law (V = I Ã— R) using simulation tools and AI explanation.

Noted how resistance increase lowers current when voltage is fixed.

Cross-verified with multiple examples and created a few mock test setups.

Visualized voltage drop using series resistor chains in simulators.

Gained confidence in applying Ohmâ€™s Law to simple problem-solving.
