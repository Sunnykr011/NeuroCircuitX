ðŸ§  NeuroCircuitX

A hands-on logbook of my hardware hacking journey

This repo is not about showcasing textbook knowledge. Itâ€™s about proving what Iâ€™ve built, tested, broken, and fixed with my own hands. Iâ€™m learning electronics, hardware debugging, and firmware analysis from scratch â€” without paid training, without a degree â€” just raw curiosity, practice, and obsession.

âš¡ Why This Repo Exists

To show:

What Iâ€™ve actually done, not just what Iâ€™ve read

What I understood and applied in real-world devices

That even without certification or money, I can reverse, repair, and rewire circuits

This repo will act as my signal to the world. Not a knowledge dump â€” but a proof of consistent action.
