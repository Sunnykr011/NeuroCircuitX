# My Hardware Hacking Journey 🛠️

This repo is a living log of my self-taught journey into hardware hacking, reverse engineering, and electronics repair.  
I’m building skills in:

- Circuit analysis
- UART/JTAG interface attacks
- Firmware extraction
- Multimeter & oscilloscope use
- Embedded system debugging

💡 All work done hands-on, without any paid training. Just passion, time, and persistence.
 Self-learned from open-source & community-shared educational content.
